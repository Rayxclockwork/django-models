**Author**: Raven Delaney
**Version**: 1.0.0 

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 401 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

Intro to Models on a django-driven site

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
Command line, VS code, internet browser
In the command line, you can build out the repo, install django, then go into a shell. 
In the shell, code out your site with the model and views.
In the command line, create your superuser
You can then go into the django-admin and add posts to your site model
After you have posts in your model, use the command line to run server and view your site. 
As it is built with HTML, CSS can be used for styling.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. This is also an area which you can include any visuals; flow charts, example usage gifs, screen captures, etc.-->
Built using Python, HTML, and Django

## API
<!-- Provide detailed instructions for your applications usage. This should include any methods or endpoints available to the user/client/developer. Each section should be formatted to provide clear syntax for usage, example calls including input data requirements and options, and example responses or return values. -->
